prüfer

![Tree](http://i.imgur.com/KUzEW3h.png)

Implements the Prüfer sequence algorithm in pure javascript, for space-efficient representation of trees using  a unique sequence. Useful for generating random trees of data. 

Here are some examples:
[3. 3. 3. 4](http://jleppert.github.io/prufer/examples/simple.html)
[4, 4, 4, 5](http://jleppert.github.io/prufer/examples/simple.html?a=4,4,4,5)

```js
var prufer = require('prufer');

// to make a tree, supply a series of integers
var tree = prufer([3, 3, 3, 4]);

// you'll get back an array of edges
console.log(tree);
// --> [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 5]]
```

Installing
-------------
Using with node:

    npm install prufer
  
For the browser, use `prufer.js`:
